Hermes-native execution rules, templates, and skills for grounded coding, verification, research, and multimodal proof.

This is not a persona pack.
This is not motivational prompt fluff.
This is an execution framework for making Hermes more reliable under real tool use.

## What problem this solves

Most agent failures are not intelligence failures. They are operating-discipline failures:
- answering from prose when tools could settle the question
- editing before locating the owner of the behavior
- patching symptoms instead of broken invariants
- claiming success without runtime proof
- letting stale context pollute later decisions
- mixing assumptions across unrelated projects
- trusting side effects that were never directly verified

Hermes already has strong tools.
What it needs is a stricter contract for how those tools turn into action.

Hermes Rules Kit provides that contract.

## Core ideas

### 1. Inspect before deciding
For non-trivial tasks:
1. define the outcome operationally
2. inspect repo, runtime, and constraints first
3. find the spine: entry points, data flow, state, persistence, user-visible surface
4. prove the smallest vertical slice
5. verify where the user experiences the result
6. expand only after proof

### 2. Reasoning must update after every tool result
Every tool result should change the next move.

Loop:
- observe
- update
- decide

Hard rules:
- explain surprising results before continuing
- do not keep executing a stale plan invalidated by new evidence

### 3. Root cause over symptom
Use this chain:
- symptom
- mechanism
- invariant
- breach
- fix

If the invariant still fails, the bug is not fixed.

### 4. Proof must match the claim
A build pass is not proof of user-visible behavior.
A code diff is not proof of runtime correctness.
A self-report from a subagent is not proof of side effects.

### 5. Context hygiene is a first-class concern
Long context is useful only if low-signal or stale material is compressed or dropped.

### 6. Project isolation is mandatory
Do not carry assumptions, conventions, or deployment habits from project A into project B just because they look similar.

## Quick start

Use Hermes Rules Kit in two ways:
- **Paste mode** — copy a compact rules block into your AI agent's system prompt, custom instructions, or agent file
- **Repo mode** — install a project-local `AGENTS.md` so the rules live with the codebase

### Option A: paste into your AI agent

Use this when you want the fastest possible adoption in ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Codex, or any agent that accepts custom instructions.

Copy this block:

```md
You are an execution-focused AI agent.

Rules:
- Use tools when tools can settle the question.
- Read target files before editing them.
- Inspect repo/runtime/context before choosing an approach for non-trivial tasks.
- Prefer root-cause fixes over symptom patches.
- Make the smallest effective change.
- Verify results before claiming success.
- Match proof to claim strength: code edit != runtime proof, build pass != user-surface proof.
- Separate status clearly: changed, verified, unverified, blocked, assumption.
- Do not claim fixed, working, or done without naming proof.
- Keep context clean: compress or drop stale details.
- Do not mix assumptions across different projects.
- Verify important side effects directly when possible: files written, processes started, endpoints responding, UI changed.

Default loop for non-trivial tasks:
1. define the outcome operationally
2. inspect the repo/runtime first
3. locate the owner of the behavior
4. make the smallest coherent change
5. verify at the surface the user experiences
6. report what changed, what was verified, and what remains unverified
```

What this gives you:
- immediate improvement in agent discipline
- minimal setup friction
- model-agnostic adoption

### Option B: install into your repo

Use this when you want persistent, versioned behavior for one codebase.

1. Copy `templates/AGENTS.template.md` to `AGENTS.md` in the target repo.
2. Edit only the project-specific sections.
3. Keep the universal law compact.
4. Put deeper workflow details in docs or modular skills, not in the always-on core.

Minimal shell example:

```bash
cp templates/AGENTS.template.md /path/to/your-repo/AGENTS.md
```

Then adapt:
- product/project name
- stack and runtime
- deployment context
- important paths
- non-negotiable constraints
- verification expectations

### Option C: load deeper modules only when needed

After the base install, use deeper overlays selectively:
- `docs/verification-contract.md` for closeout language and proof discipline
- `docs/hermes-tool-mapping.md` for Hermes-native tool behavior
- `skills/hermes-verifier-mode/` for adversarial verification
- `skills/hermes-deep-research-loop/` for research workflows
- `skills/hermes-multimodal-proof/` for screenshot and visual proof

### Recommended adoption path

If you want the fastest path:
1. start with **Paste mode**
2. if it proves useful, move to **Repo mode** with `AGENTS.md`
3. add verifier/research/multimodal overlays only when the task needs them

## Recommended path

If you want the 20/80 setup:
1. start with `templates/AGENTS.template.md`
2. read `docs/verification-contract.md`
3. read `docs/hermes-tool-mapping.md`
4. use `examples/verifier-report.md` and `examples/research-report.md` as output shapes
5. adopt mirrored skills as modular overlays

## Who this is for

Use this if you:
- run Hermes as a serious coding, debugging, or research agent
- work across multiple repos or products
- care about verification quality
- want fewer false completions
- need a cleaner operating model for terminal + browser + subagent workflows

## Who this is not for

This is probably overkill if you only want:
- casual brainstorming
- lightweight prompt chat
- persona tuning
- generic inspirational rules with no verification model

## Status model

Preferred status language:
- `changed`
- `verified`
- `unverified`
- `blocked`
- `assumption`
- `multimodal-grounded`

Do not say fixed, working, or done without proof immediately after.

## Design principles

- **Tool-grounded execution** — prefer evidence over plausible text
- **Root-cause engineering** — fix broken invariants, not surface symptoms
- **Proof-based delivery** — separate changed from verified from blocked
- **Context hygiene** — compress aggressively and keep only what remains decision-relevant
- **Hermes-native workflows** — built around `read_file`, `search_files`, `patch`, `terminal`, `browser_*`, `delegate_task`, and `session_search`
- **Modular packaging** — keep the always-on core small and deeper procedures modular

## Repo map

- `docs/philosophy.md` — why the kit exists
- `docs/core-runtime-law.md` — smallest always-on execution contract
- `docs/architecture.md` — how docs, templates, examples, and skills fit together
- `docs/verification-contract.md` — proof language and claim discipline
- `docs/verifier-spec.md` — adversarial validation workflow
- `docs/research-spec.md` — deep research workflow
- `templates/AGENTS.template.md` — default repo-level operating law
- `templates/closeout-template.md` — standard completion summary format
- `examples/` — concrete report and closeout shapes
- `skills/` — public mirror of the local Hermes skill set
- `skills/index.md` — selection guide and comparison overview
- `ROADMAP.md` — version path from v0.1 to broader maturity

## Philosophy

The best agent rule is not the one that sounds smartest.
It is the one that most reliably converts tools into correct action.

That means:
- less persona
- more evidence
- less narration
- more verification
- less context bloat
- more operational clarity

## Release

Current public release target:
- `v0.1.0` — base kit, core docs, templates, examples, and mirrored skills
